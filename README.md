# From Reading to Coding - Self-study

<small><i><strong>(Nguyen Truong Thinh)</strong></i></small><br>
___

### The Brief Introduction

> As a `mobile app developer` with more than 3 years of experience but with no<br>
> background in machine learning. I found these books to be pure gold. I want to <br>
> understand Machine Learning algorithms and will find tutorials to teach the concepts<br>
> required, with a final hands-on application at the end that is useful. <br><br>
> I have read many artificial intelligence books. But most of the books are heavily<br>
> focused on the mathematics of artificial intelligence, which makes them difficult to<br>
> understand for people without mathematics or computer science backgrounds.<br>
> I have always wanted to find out a book that could make it easier to get into<br>
> the artificial intelligence field for beginners—people from all different disciplines.<br><br>
> Thanks to `the countless researchers` and `developers` around the world and<br>
> their open source code, particularly Python-based open source code, it is<br>
> much easier to use artificial intelligence now than 10 years ago. <br>
> Through these books, I will find that I can do amazing things with just<br>
> a few lines of code, and in some cases, I don’t need to code at all.
